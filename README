# Programming in C
This is a repository that holds samples, notes from Introduction to C and Advanced C
Tips and tricks

To understand how the assembler is compiling your application use gcc -S command as below example:
``` bash
gcc -S numwords.c
```
The above command generates numwords.s file
Note that typically, exclude .s files to source control
In this case, only numwords.s is included. See .gitignore to find out how it is done. More of .gitignore cheatsheet can be found [in GIT SCM Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
