# Chapter 3 Pointers and Indirection

added samples from advanced chapter 3 pointers and indirection

This chapter discusses pointers and indirection

Pointers helps in referring a variable value using its address instead of the variable directly.

The primary purpose of pointers and its benefits include

1. Refer many number of values at ease with less number of variables
2. Return more than one value from functions
3. Faster computing wih less logic when indexer is not used
4. Refer value storage location directly than indexer
