# Chapter 3 Pointers and Indirection

This chapter discusses pointers and indirection
The examples show how an array of values can be referred by different address mechanisms for Arrays. 
Array[0] is really the address of the first item in an array.
Array variable is also reference of the first address in an array.


Pointer is address of a variable.

Pointers helps in referring a variable value using its address instead of the variable directly.

The primary purpose of pointers and its benefits include

1. Refer many number of values at ease with less number of variables
2. Return more than one value from functions
3. Faster computing wih less logic when indexer is not used
4. Refer value storage location directly than indexer

* Completed:
added samples from advanced chapter 3 pointers and indirection


* TODO: 
How to use buffer, how to limit reading strings in StdIo, ragged right string
